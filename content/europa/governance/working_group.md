The Europa SDI Working Group is the decision-making body of the SDI. The working group members collaboratively formulate the mission, vision, governance model, data and metadata standards, and strategic direction for the development and maintenance of the Europa SDI. This working group approves work efforts required to meet the strategic goals of this group and provide guidance to support the implementation of those decisions. The working group also establishes and maintains relationships with NASA program managers, data providers, and community user groups and stakeholders, such as Europa science and engineering communities, mission teams (e.g., Europa Clipper and JUICE), software application and tool developers, media relation activities, public engagement and education groups, and members of the general public.

## Membership 
This working group consists of voluntary working group members and topical sub-groups.  There is one chair, one co-chair, and an unlimited number of members.

Current Membership Includes:
- Jason (Jay) Laura, Chair, USGS Astrogeology Science Center, jlaura@usgs.gov
- Ross Beyer, SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center, rbeyer@seti.org
- Michael (Mike) Bland, USGS Astrogeology Science Center, mbland@usgs.gov
- Robin Fergason, USGS Astrogeology Science Center, rfergason@usgs.gov
- Trent Hare, USGS Astrogeology Science Center, thare@usgs.gov
- Cynthia Phillips, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, cynthia.b.phillips@jpl.nasa.gov
- Paul Schenk, Lunar and Planetary Institute, schenk@lpi.usra.edu

Working group memberships are not time limited. There is no maximum size of the working group. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The working group must have at least five members. Chairs and co-chair terms are for one year each from October 1 to September 30. During the August meeting, individuals self-nominate to serve as co-chair and the working group determines the new co-chair by majority vote. After the one-year term, the co-chair then serves as the working group chair. A change of the chair and/or co-chair can be made mid-year by the same process described above and as deemed necessary by consensus of the working group members. Mid-year changes are expected to be rare.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for working group membership. The working group may add additional members by consensus. If there are any objections to adding any individual member, an attempt should be made to resolve those objections following the Consensus Seeking Process (see section 5.2). A working group member may be removed from the group by voluntary resignation, or by consensus of all other members.

Changes to working group membership should be posted in the agenda and may be suggested as any other agenda item. If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full working group is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting. This policy is to ensure that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all membership decisions.

In the case where an individual working group member -- within any twelve-month period -- attends fewer than 25% of the regularly scheduled meetings, does not participate in working group discussions, and does not participate in working group votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the working group. The member may be invited to continue attending working group meetings as an observer.
