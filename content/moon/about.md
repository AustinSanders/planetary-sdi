The Lunar SDI began meeting regularly in November of 2022. The group is comprised of subject matter experts from NASA centers, the USRA Lunar and Planetary Institute, and the USGS. This group is focused on the collation and stewardship of data discoverability and accessability standards. These standards ensure that analysis ready lunar data works for users without expert spatial data knowledge. Our vision is that scientists, engineers, and interest persons will be able to FAIRly access open data to further their interests in lunar discovery.
