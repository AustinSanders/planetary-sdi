## Data and Licensing Standards
Data and derived products within this SDI conform to a set of standards to maximize interoperability, including standardized vertical and horizontal datums (i.e., the coordinate system), accepted map projections, and metadata formats. Significant effort was made to use standards that are consistent with IAU recommendations, those in use by relevant mission teams, and that foster interoperability. See the Guidelines for Lunar Data Providers for detailed information regarding the standards and formats the Lunar SDI adheres to, with the goal of maximizing interoperability between datasets and reducing the need to reproject or reprocess data. 

In addition, all data made publicly available through the Lunar SDI should use an open-data license. See the Guidelines for Lunar Data Providers for additional information regarding license guidance.
