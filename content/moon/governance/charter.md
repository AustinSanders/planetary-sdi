**DRAFT**

## Summary
The Lunar Spatial Data Infrastructure working group will evaluate existing spatial data and data standards for the moon and assess spatial data storage, acquisition, discovery, and use needs of the Lunar community. Spatial data infrastructure (SDI) is the enabling collection of spatial data users, data interoperability agreements, policies and standards, data access mechanisms, and the spatial data themselves (Rajabifard et al., 2002). The overarching goal of the Lunar SDI is to allow individuals that are not spatial data experts to use spatial data to the greatest extent possible, with the lowest possible overhead (Laura et al., 2018). This working group will address complexities by defining policies and standards that will be applicable to this SDI regarding data interoperability, data contribution, and the long-term maintenance of this SDI for the benefit of all user communities.

## Objectives
Publish and steward the policy infrastructure necessary to maintain this SDI including this charter, user and contributor agreements to support data release and sharing agreements, and a roadmap map of future development.

Engage with the user community, funding agencies, and NASA Advisory Groups to ensure the efforts of this body maximally align with targeted user community needs.
- Publish and steward the policy infrastructure necessary to maintain this SDI, including a charter, governance documentation, user and contributor agreements support data release and sharing agreements, and a roadmap of future development.
- Engage with the user community, funding agencies, and NASA Advisory Groups to ensure the efforts of this body maximally align with targeted user community needs.
- Publish an initial set of standards that will define this SDI including standardized vertical and horizontal datums (i.e., the coordinate system), documentation requirements for selecting cartographic standards, interoperable data formats, and metadata formats.
- Maintain, in conjunction with the Lunar community, a living inventory of foundational and framework data products including quantitative (e.g., positional accuracy, resolution, data producer) and qualitative (e.g., fitness-for-use) metadata. This includes setting a standard for metadata to be reported for all data products publicized and promoted through the Lunar SDI organization.
- Provide a mechanism to bring together users, such as data creators (who make the data products), custodians (who manage the data products lifecycle), and data integrators (who provide the data to end users) to create an interconnected user group.
- Support (through policies and standards) the development of data discovery and access portals making use of Lunar SDI promoted data and associated Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
- Ensure the public release of all Lunar SDI promoted data products and APIs.
- Engage with tool developers to ensure support for data and standards included in the Lunar SDI.
